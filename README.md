This app is pretty intuitive and targeted at someone who knows about 20% of what they're looking for. If you're looking for a diagram you can find it in the diagrams, if you're looking for maintenance data or how-tos you can find them in maintenance section, if you can't find what you're looking for in the app then the external links section can get you to even more information about your bike.
